# **Leap Year**

The Leap Year program tells the user if a particular year is a leap year. This training project, prepared by [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-c-plus-plus), has been an invaluable exercise in applying the knowledge I learned in learning to use conditional statements using C++.

## Project Prompt

Write a `leap_year.cpp` program that:

1. Takes a year as input.
2. Checks to see if the year is a four-digit number.
3. Displays whether or not the year falls on a [leap year](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leap_year).

There are 3 criteria that must be taken into account to identify a leap year:

- If the year can be evenly divided by 4 then it is a leap year, howeverâ€¦
- If that year can be evenly divided by 100, and it is not evenly divided by 400, then it is NOT a leap year.
- If that year is evenly divisible by 400, then it is a leap year.

Take some time to research and brainstorm before starting to write the code!

## Technologies

- C++

## Setup

Generally, you would want to compile and execute the program locally. To do that:

1. Download `leap_year.cpp`.
2. Open the terminal or command line and navigate to the directory where the downloaded file resides.
3. Run the following commands to compile and execute the program:

```git
g++ leap_year.cpp -o leap_year
./leap_year
```
